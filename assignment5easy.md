# Assignment - 5 (I/O and Memory Management)

## Answer the short questions:

### 1. **What is Direct Memory Access (DMA)?**

- **DMA** allows devices (like hard drives) to transfer data directly to/from memory without involving the CPU.
- **Why useful?** It frees up the CPU to do other tasks and speeds up data transfer.

---

### 2. **Define Device Driver and its Purpose.**

- A **Device Driver** is special software that helps the OS communicate with hardware devices.
- **Purpose**: It acts like a translator between the OS and devices like printers, keyboards, etc.

---

### 3. **What is Seek Time and Latency in Disk Scheduling?**

- **Seek Time**: Time taken for the disk’s read/write head to move to the right track.
- **Latency (Rotational Delay)**: Time the disk waits for the correct sector to rotate under the head.
- **Together**, they affect how fast data can be read or written.

---

### 4. **Explain the Purpose of Cache Memory in OS.**

- **Cache Memory** is a small, fast memory close to the CPU.
- **Purpose**: Stores frequently used data to speed up access.
- It helps the CPU get data faster than fetching it from slower RAM.

---

### 5. **Define Thrashing in Virtual Memory.**

- **Thrashing** happens when the OS spends more time swapping data in and out of memory than doing real work.
- It makes the system **very slow**.
- **Cause**: Too many processes using more memory than available.

---

### 6. **What is the Purpose of Page Replacement Algorithms?**

- When memory is full, the OS must decide **which page to remove** to make space.
- **Page Replacement Algorithms** help choose the best page to remove with the least impact on performance.

---

### 7. **Explain FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithm.**

- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)** processes disk requests in the order they arrive.
- **Simple and fair**, but not always fast, especially if requests are far apart on the disk.

---

### 8. **What is the Difference Between SSTF and SCAN Scheduling?**

- **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**: Picks the request nearest to the current head position.
  - ✅ Faster
  - ❌ Can starve far-away requests
- **SCAN**: Moves the head in one direction, servicing all requests, then reverses.
  - ✅ More fair
  - ❌ Slower than SSTF sometimes

---

### 9. **Define Spooling and Its Role in OS.**

- **Spooling** stores data in a queue before sending it to a device.
- **Role**: Helps manage multiple requests for a device like a printer, allowing smoother and organized processing.

---

### 10. **What is the Purpose of I/O Scheduling in OS?**

- **I/O Scheduling** decides the order of input/output requests.
- **Purpose**:
  - Improve speed
  - Reduce waiting time
  - Prevent one process from hogging the I/O

## Answer the long questions:

### 1. **Functions of Device Management in an OS**

- **Keeps track of devices**: OS maintains a record of all connected input/output (I/O) devices.
- **Controls device usage**: Allocates devices to processes and manages their use.
- **Schedules device access**: Decides which process gets access to a device and when.
- **Handles communication**: Sends commands to devices and receives responses.
- **Manages drivers**: Uses special software (drivers) to interact with hardware.

---

### 2. **Different Device Characteristics and Their Impact on OS**

- **Speed**: Devices work at different speeds (e.g., keyboard is slower than a hard disk). The OS needs to handle this.
- **Shared vs. Dedicated**: Some devices (like printers) are shared, while others (like monitors) are dedicated.
- **Transfer Mode**: Can be character-by-character (keyboard) or block-by-block (disk).
- **Input or Output**: Devices can be input-only (keyboard), output-only (monitor), or both (touch screen).
- **Impact**: The OS must adapt its management strategies based on these characteristics.

---

### 3. **Disk Space Management in OS**

- **Tracks free space**: Maintains a list of free and used disk blocks.
- **File allocation**: Assigns disk space to files when they are created or modified.
- **Manages fragmentation**: Tries to minimize gaps between file blocks to improve speed.
- **Tools used**: Free-space list, bitmaps, or linked lists to manage space efficiently.

---

### 4. **Disk Allocation Methods in OS**

- **Contiguous Allocation**: Files are stored in consecutive blocks.
  - ✅ Fast access
  - ❌ Wastes space if the file grows.
- **Linked Allocation**: Each file block points to the next one.
  - ✅ No wasted space
  - ❌ Slow for random access
- **Indexed Allocation**: A special block contains indexes (pointers) to all file blocks.
  - ✅ Supports direct access
  - ❌ Extra space needed for index block

---

### 5. **Disk Scheduling Algorithms in OS**

- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**: Processes disk requests in the order they arrive.
- **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**: Chooses the request closest to the current position.
- **SCAN**: Moves head in one direction, servicing requests, then reverses.
- **LOOK**: Like SCAN, but only goes as far as the last request in that direction.
- **C-SCAN / C-LOOK**: Moves in one direction and then jumps back to the start.

---

### 6. **Interrupt Handling in Device Management**

- **What is an interrupt?**: A signal from a device to get the CPU’s attention.
- **How it works**:
  1. Device sends interrupt signal.
  2. CPU stops current task.
  3. OS handles the device's request (via interrupt handler).
  4. CPU resumes previous task.
- **Purpose**: Helps the CPU respond quickly to device requests.

---

### 7. **I/O Buffering in OS**

- **What is buffering?**: Temporary storage used during I/O operations.
- **Types**:
  - **Single Buffering**: One buffer used. Slower.
  - **Double Buffering**: Two buffers used alternately. Faster.
  - **Circular Buffering**: Multiple buffers in a loop. Efficient for high-speed data.
- **Why it's used**: Smoothens speed difference between CPU and devices.

---

### 8. **Spooling and Its Importance**

- **What is spooling?**: Storing data in a queue (usually on a disk) before sending to a device.
- **Example**: Print jobs are stored before sending to the printer.
- **Importance**:
  - Allows multiple jobs to wait in line.
  - Increases efficiency.
  - Avoids conflicts when many processes want to use the same device.

---

### 9. **Virtual Memory in Device Management**

- **What is virtual memory?**: A memory management technique where part of the hard disk is used as RAM.
- **How it works**:
  - Programs think they have more memory than available.
  - OS swaps data between RAM and disk (paging).
- **Benefits**:
  - Runs larger programs than RAM size.
  - Allows multitasking.
  - Reduces memory waste.

---

### 10. **Deadlock in Device Management and Its Prevention**

- **What is a deadlock?**: When two or more processes wait forever for each other’s resources.
- **Example**: Process A holds printer and waits for scanner. Process B holds scanner and waits for printer.
- **Prevention methods**:
  - **Avoid circular wait**: Don’t allow processes to hold one device and wait for another.
  - **Use timeouts**: Cancel requests if not fulfilled in time.
  - **Resource hierarchy**: Always request resources in a specific order.
